Mumble Positional Audio Helper is a small tool for testing the functionality
of positional audio plugins outside of Mumble.

To test your plugin place it next to MumblePAHelper's executable and launch it.

## Default paths

### Windows
System directory: **C:\Program Files\Mumble\Plugins** or **C:\Program Files (x86)\Mumble\Plugins**

User directory: **%AppData%\Roaming\Mumble\Plugins**

### Linux
System directory: **/usr/lib/mumble**

User directory: **~/.local/share/Mumble/Mumble/Plugins**
___
Mumble installs the plugins in the system directory and downloads the updated ones in the user
directory.

On Windows you need to set the system directory manually if you are using a development snapshot
or you have installed Mumble in a custom location.
